# Typst fullpage AMS template
This repository contains a customization of [Typst's standard AMS template](https://github.com/typst/templates/blob/2b629bdc1eb0edb91375b5b873725290d3bba0d7/ams/template.typ) so that it looks like TeX's amsart using the fullpage package.
We ([@leticiamat](https://leticiamat.github.io/) and I) created this to match the common $\LaTeX$ format we use in our clique of colleages, so it also features other changes.
